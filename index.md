### About
I’m Jie Hao, I obtained the Ph.D. degree in Statistics at [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu){:target="_blank”} (FSU), advised by Jinfeng Zhang. My research broadly lies around Natural Language Processing and Statistical Machine Learning. My current research focuses on Machine Translation and Text Generation.
